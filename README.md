# Street Vendor Business Intelligence System

## 📌 Overview
Street vendors are an essential part of the informal economy, yet most of them operate without any tools to track profit, inventory, or customer demand. This project addresses that gap by providing a simple, user-friendly Business Intelligence system designed specifically for small street vendors.

The system allows vendors to enter basic sales data and automatically generates meaningful insights such as profit analysis, best-selling items, demand trends, and potential wastage risks.
